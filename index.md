# What is ResponsiveML for?

ResponsiveML is best for the use cases with the following requirements:
1. Online prediction with strict latency requirements (e.g. in hundred of milliseconds or seconds).
2. Time-aware features such as: count, sum, mean, percentile, etc. over a time window.
3. Your models benefit from feature freshness.
4. Using real-time transports like Kafka, Kinesis to move data.

Example use cases that match these requirements: fraud prevention & detection, dynamic pricing, customer support, in-session personalization, risk assessment, cybersecurity, etc.
